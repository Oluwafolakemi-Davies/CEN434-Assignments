    <p class="content">
      Child marriage is a serious social issue that affects millions of young girls around the world.
      It often forces children, especially girls, into adult responsibilities far too early, robbing them
      of their childhood, education, and dreams.
    </p>

    <p class="content">
      Many families believe they are protecting their daughters by marrying them off early, but in reality,
      this practice exposes them to <span class="highlight">health risks, abuse, and lifelong poverty</span>.
      Education remains one of the strongest tools to break this cycle, empowering girls to make informed
      choices about their futures.
    </p>

    <p class="content">
      Ending child marriage requires strong laws, community awareness, and support for girls to stay in school.
      Every child deserves a chance to grow up, learn, and live freely before making such life-changing decisions.
